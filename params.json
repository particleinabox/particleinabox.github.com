Here, the particle may only move backwards and forwards along a straight line with impenetrable barriers at either end. The walls of a one-dimensional box may be visualised as regions of space with an infinitely large potential energy. Conversely, the interior of the box has a constant, zero potential energy. This means that no forces act upon the particle inside the box and it can move freely in that region. However, infinitely large forces repel the particle if it touches the walls of the box, preventing it from escaping. The potential energy in this model is given as\r\n\r\n![V(x) = \\begin{cases} 0, & 0 < x < L,\\\\ \\infty, & \\text{otherwise,} \\end{cases}] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/b/9/4/b94d95645c39f37b499186cac4888c52.png)\r\n\r\nwhere L is the length of the box and x is the position of the particle within the box.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, [Particle in a box](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_in_a_box)\r\n\r\n","name":"Particle-In-a-Box"}
